# Toy Language Interpreter
 * Implemented an interpreter for a toy language, using the model-view-controller architectural pattern and the object-oriented 
concepts.
 * The interpreter handles expressions and statements.
 * A program (`Prg`) in this language consists of a statement (`Stmt`).
 * A statement can be:
    - a compound statement (`CompStmt`)
    - an assignment statement (`AssignStmt`)
    - a print statement (`PrintStmt`)
    - a conditional statement (`IfStmt`)
    - a no opertaion statement (`NopStmt`) 
    - a variable declaration statement (`VarDeclStmt`)
    - a while statement (`WhileStmt`)
    - a for statement (`ForStmt`)
    - etc.
 *
